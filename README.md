# PSNote
- A simple notes manager for quick notes.

## Installation
- Clone the repo into your windows modules folder.
  - Or alternatively any other folder within your PSScriptPath.

### Dependencies
- Requires the following modules of mine:
  - [Read-Menu](https://github.com/Sondre071/Read-Menu)
  - [ModuleData](https://github.com/Sondre071/ModuleData)

## Usage
- Invoke the module with the keywords `PSNote` or `Note`.

## Setting and updating notes
- The module has basic functionality for adding and changing notes, but it is a work in progress.
- You may update your notes collection manually in a text editor by invoking `PSNote -Edit`.

## Viewing notes
- Navigate the menu using arrows ↑↓, esc and enter
- Vim bindings also work: JKLQ
